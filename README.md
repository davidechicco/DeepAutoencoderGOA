# DeepAutoencoderGOA
Deep autoencoder neural networks for Gene Ontology annotation predictions. This Torch lua software trains and applies a deep autoencoder neural network to predict Gene Ontology (GO) annotations.

To run the optimization phase, type:

`th autoencoder_DataReadingChoosing_RocCurves_AllHUs_AllNewTaus_MultiLayer_2017.lua`

To test, type:

`th autoencoder_DataReadingChoosing_Test_AllHUs_AllNewTaus_SingleLayer_SortAPlist_2017.lua`

This sofware code was developed in early 2014 by [Davide Chicco](http://www.davidechicco.it) at the University of California Irvine and is related to the paper ["Deep autoencoder neural networks for Gene Ontology annotation predictions"](https://doi.org/10.1145/2649387.2649442) by Davide Chicco, Peter Sadowski, Pierre Baldi, published in the *Proceedings of ACM BCB 2014 - the 5th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics*, 20th September 2014, Newport Beach, California, USA. https://doi.org/10.1145/2649387.2649442
